# GVisMaps
Dataset of three sets of generalizable visibility maps for planning SAR observations in challenging terrain. Code for visualizing and processing generalizable visibility map data is included.

Generalizable visibility map data is stored in the folder "data." Use the script "visualize.py" to visualize the visibility map data and the script estimate_vis.py to estimate the visibility of a user-defined region of interest shape file.
